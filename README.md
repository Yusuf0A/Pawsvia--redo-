# Pawsvia – Finding Your Pawfect Match

## Overview
**Pawsvia** is a personalized pet adoption web application that helps users find adoptable pets near them based on the personality traits they’re looking for in a companion. 

## Problem
Traditional pet adoption websites often lack emotional context. Many people adopt pets for companionship that fits their lifestyle and current feelings. Pawsvia introduces a mood-driven discovery experience that enhances compatibility and aims to improve long-term adoption outcomes and attempts to reduce the chances of pet abandonment.

## Features
- Mood-based pet matching (e.g., playful, calm, cuddly, adventurous)
- Location-based search using ZIP code
- Pet gallery with real-time data from the Petfinder API
- Individual pet profiles with bios, photos, and contact information
- Favorites system using browser localStorage
- Shelter map integration
- Optional dark mode toggle
